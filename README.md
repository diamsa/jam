## About Nostr:

NOSTR is an acronym meaning "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted through Relays". It is an alternative and open protocol for exchanging simple structured information publicly through relays your client(s) are connected to.  With Nostr, you cannot be deplatformed, and you are not fed an algorithm by default.  You can move between clients that evolve over time.
